# Golf Content on Youtube Recap

The original reason that we set out to collect the data on our three golf channels (gm_golf, Good Good Golf, and Bob Does Sports) was to find what factors contribute to the success of a golf channel on Youtube. To collect our data, <a href="https://jdubindaclub.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/14/golf.html"> we used Google's Youtube API</a> to pull the data from the channels. In our EDA stage, <a href="https://jdubindaclub.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/30/eda.html"> we looked at the different metrics of each channel</a> to see what they had in common, and what differentiated them.

# Findings

gm_golf, Good Good Golf, and Bob Does Sports all upload golf entertainment content. There were some similarities accross channels, such as growth rate, and variability of views. Besides those similarities, everything else was different. I expected the three channels to have more similarities, seeing as though they all make the same kind of content. However, it appears that despite that fact, each channel has nurtered different audiences that have different behaviors. Here is a graphic that illustrates some of the differences between the channels:

This is a great illustration of the different behaviors of the three audiences. gm_golf gets the same amount of views no matter when they uploaded a video. Good Good Golf receives more views when they post in the afternoon. Bob Does Sports receives the most views when they upload in the evening. 

# Conclusion

To conclude, we can say that there are no clear factors that contribute to the success of a golf channel on Youtube. Each channel has a different audience that behaves differently. If you are looking to start a golf channel on Youtube, it will be best to grow an audience and cater to them.
