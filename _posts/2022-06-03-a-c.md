# My plan for blog 3


I want to see how many videos per year a golf channel uploads. I will use APLILayer's Youtube API to get the data. I will use the GET channel/videos endpoint to get the data. I will pull three of the biggest golf channels: Good Good Golf, Rick Shiels Golf, and Fore Play Golf. Although somewhat tricky, I have already found the channel ID's of these three channels, which is what I need to use the API.
