# My plan for blog 3


I want to see how many videos per year a golf channel uploads. I will use APLILayer's Youtube API to get the data. I will use the GET channel/videos endpoint to get the data. I will pull four of my favorite golf channels: Good Good Golf, Rick Shiels Golf, Bob Does Sports, and Fore Play Golf. Although somewhat tricky, I have already found the channel ID's of these four channels, which is what I need to use the API.



# Reason

I love golf and even have a golf instagram page. Starting a youtube channel where I post my own golf content is something that has often crossed my mind, but I've never researched how many videos a popular golf page posts per year.
