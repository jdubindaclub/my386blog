- I am currently working through 10 or so different machine learning models, and applying them to different datasets. This is to familiarize myself with a few simple models. I can include these for a "how to" post.

- I am interested in reading Weapons of Math Destruction. Algorithmic bias is something I have always been interested in.

- I have a bunch of previously gathered datasets that I have used for machine learning projects (all of them are .arff files). I believe I will use one of those.
